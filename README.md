# mrft (mlp real function trainer)
Small GUI used for training MLP with real functions.

Libraries used
--------------
- [`libai`](https://github.com/kronenthaler/libai): MLP implementation
- [`exp4j`](https://github.com/dktcoding/exp4j): Populating datasets, transformations and noise
- [`jDrawingLib`](https://github.com/dktcoding/jdrawinglib): Plotting functions, and creating images and animations
- Others (that I will name in time)

Objectives
----------
The main reason for this program was to allow students to play with MLPs with real functions, tests different configurations, etc.

There have been some real life applications (some even "cool"), that will be properly described later on.

Building
--------
Building is as simple as:
- `git clone https://github.com/dktcoding/mrft.git`
- `cd mrft`
- `ant build-all`
